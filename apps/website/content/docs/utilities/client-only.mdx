title: Client Only
description: Usad to render content only on the client side
---

The ClientOnly component renders its children only on the client side. This is useful for components
that need to access the DOM or browser APIs that are not available on the server side.

## Usage

```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@fidely-ui/react'
```

```tsx
<ClientOnly>Hey, running on client only.</ClientOnly>
```

## Examples

### Basic

```tsx
<ClientOnly>
  <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
</ClientOnly>
```

### With Fallback

```tsx
<ClientOnly fallback={<Skeleton noOfLines={1} />}>
  <div>This content is only rendered on the client side.</div>
</ClientOnly>
```
