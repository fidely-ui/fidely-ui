# Color Pairing

Snaps UI lets you combine neutral and accent tones to shape your brand’s unique visual style.
By default, the system pairs neutral as both the gray and accent base — giving a clean, minimal look out of the box.

However, you can easily swap in any color from the Snaps palette to craft a personality that fits your product —
from calm and muted to bold and expressive.
